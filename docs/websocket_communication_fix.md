# WebSocket Communication Fix

## Problem Identified
- **Go WebSocket server not handling multiple clients properly**
- **Redis subscription goroutine leak** - new subscription created per client join
- **No room-based client management** - clients isolated from each other
- **Memory leaks** from unclosed Redis subscriptions

## Root Cause
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client 1 Joins] --> B[New Redis Subscription]
    C[Client 2 Joins] --> D[Another Redis Subscription]
    E[Client 3 Joins] --> F[Another Redis Subscription]
    
    B --> G[Same Room Channel]
    D --> G
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[Multiple Goroutines Processing Same Messages]
    H --> I[Resource Waste + Confusion]
```

## Solution Implemented

### Server Structure Changes
- **Added room management maps** to track clients by room
- **Single Redis subscription per room** instead of per client
- **Proper cleanup** when clients disconnect

### Code Changes Made
- `Server struct`: Added `rooms` and `roomSubscriptions` fields
- `handleJoin()`: Check if room subscription exists before creating
- `subscribeToRoom()`: Use room-specific subscription management
- `handleWebSocket()`: Clean up room data on client disconnect

## Fixed Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Client Side"
        A[Browser 1]
        B[Browser 2] 
        C[Browser 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Go Server"
        D[WebSocket Handler]
        E[Room Manager]
        F[Redis Subscriber]
    end
    
    subgraph "Redis"
        G[(Redis Channel)]
    end
    
    A -->|"WebSocket"| D
    B -->|"WebSocket"| D
    C -->|"WebSocket"| D
    
    D --> E
    E -->|"One Sub Per Room"| F
    F <-->|"Pub/Sub"| G
    
    F -->|"Broadcast to Room"| E
    E --> D
    D --> A
    D --> B
    D --> C
```

## Message Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C1 as Client 1
    participant C2 as Client 2
    participant GS as Go Server
    participant R as Redis
    
    C1->>GS: Join Room "hackathon-room"
    GS->>R: Subscribe to "room:hackathon-room"
    
    C2->>GS: Join Room "hackathon-room" 
    Note over GS: Reuses existing subscription
    
    C1->>GS: Send Stroke Data
    GS->>R: Publish to "room:hackathon-room"
    R->>GS: Message received
    GS->>C1: Broadcast stroke
    GS->>C2: Broadcast stroke
```

## Key Fixes
- **Memory leak fixed** - subscriptions properly cleaned up
- **Single subscription per room** - eliminates duplicate processing  
- **Room-based broadcasting** - messages only go to correct clients
- **Connection tracking** - server knows which clients are in which rooms

## Testing Results
- ✅ Multiple browser tabs now sync in real-time
- ✅ Go server running on port 8080
- ✅ Frontend connects successfully 
- ✅ Redis pub/sub working correctly
- ✅ No goroutine leaks

## Services Status
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[PostgreSQL :5432] --> B[✅ Connected]
    C[Redis :6379] --> D[✅ Connected] 
    E[Go Server :8080] --> F[✅ Running]
    G[Frontend :5173] --> H[✅ Running]
    
    I[WebSocket Communication] --> J[✅ Fixed]
```

## Files Modified
- `go-server/main.go` - Server struct, room management, subscription handling
- Server initialization - Added room and subscription maps

The WebSocket communication between multiple clients is now working correctly with proper resource management.
